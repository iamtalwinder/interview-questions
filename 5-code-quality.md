Certainly, here are 6 intermediate to advanced questions on Code Quality & Standards, each with two follow-up questions and a two-line answer for each.

### Code Quality & Standards (6 questions)

1. **Question:** What is linting and how does it improve code quality?
    - **Answer:** Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors and code style issues. It enforces a consistent coding style and catches common errors early.
    - **Follow-up 1:** What are some popular linting tools for React projects?
    - **Answer:** ESLint and Prettier are commonly used linting tools in React projects.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Can custom linting rules be created?
    - **Answer:** Yes, most linting tools like ESLint allow you to create custom rules tailored to your project's needs.

2. **Question:** Explain the concept of "Code Splitting" in React.
    - **Answer:** Code splitting involves breaking up your application code into smaller chunks to improve load performance.
    - **Follow-up 1:** How can you implement code splitting in a React application?
    - **Answer:** React’s `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` allow for dynamic imports and easy code splitting.
    - **Follow-up 2:** What are some pitfalls to avoid when implementing code splitting?
    - **Answer:** Avoid over-splitting and be mindful of the network latency associated with fetching multiple small chunks.

3. **Question:** What are React PropTypes and why are they important?
    - **Answer:** PropTypes are used for type-checking in React and they help in debugging by validating the props a component receives.
    - **Follow-up 1:** Are PropTypes necessary in TypeScript projects?
    - **Answer:** PropTypes are generally not required in TypeScript projects, as TypeScript provides its own type-checking mechanisms.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Can default props be defined when using PropTypes?
    - **Answer:** Yes, default props can be specified, which will be used if a prop is not provided.

4. **Question:** What are hooks for side-effects and why are they useful for code quality?
    - **Answer:** Hooks like `useEffect` manage side-effects in functional components, making code easier to reason about and test.
    - **Follow-up 1:** What are the dependency array and cleanup function in `useEffect`?
    - **Answer:** The dependency array controls when the effect runs, and the cleanup function runs when the component unmounts or before the next effect.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Are there linting rules specific to hooks?
    - **Answer:** Yes, ESLint rules like `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` and `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` help enforce best practices for hooks.

5. **Question:** Explain the importance of unit tests in a React application.
    - **Answer:** Unit tests ensure each component’s functionality, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing bugs.
    - **Follow-up 1:** What are some popular libraries for testing React components?
    - **Answer:** Jest and React Testing Library are popular choices for testing React components.
    - **Follow-up 2:** How do unit tests affect Continuous Integration (CI)?
    - **Answer:** Unit tests are often run as part of a CI pipeline to automatically catch regressions and improve code quality.

6. **Question:** What is "tree shaking" and how does it affect code quality?
    - **Answer:** Tree shaking is a build optimization step that removes unused code, improving the application's performance.
    - **Follow-up 1:** How can you ensure your code is tree-shakable?
    - **Answer:** Using ES modules and avoiding side effects in your code can help make it tree-shakable.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Can tree shaking be applied to CSS and other assets?
    - **Answer:** Yes, certain build tools like Webpack can apply tree shaking to CSS and other static assets.

I hope these questions, along with the follow-ups and answers, are helpful for deepening your understanding of code quality and standards in React development. Feel free to ask for more details or clarifications!
