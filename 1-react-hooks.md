Certainly! Here are 6 intermediate to advanced React Hooks questions, each with two follow-ups and a two-line answer for each.

### React Hooks (6 questions)

1. **Question:** Can you explain the purpose of `useState` in React?
    - **Answer:** `useState` is a Hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns the current state and a function to update it.
    - **Follow-up 1:** How is `useState` different from `this.state` in class components?
    - **Answer:** `useState` provides better reusability and doesnâ€™t involve `this`, which makes it simpler and easier to manage.
    - **Follow-up 2:** What happens if you call `useState` conditionally? 0
    - **Answer:** Calling `useState` conditionally will break the rules of Hooks and lead to unpredictable behavior.

2. **Question:** What is `useEffect` used for?
    - **Answer:** `useEffect` runs side-effects in functional components, such as API calls or subscriptions.
    - **Follow-up 1:** Can `useEffect` replace lifecycle methods?
    - **Answer:** Yes, `useEffect` can effectively replace `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
    - **Follow-up 2:** How can you run an effect only once?
    - **Answer:** Pass an empty dependency array (`[]`) as the second argument to `useEffect`.

3. **Question:** What is the `useRef` Hook and how is it different from `createRef`?
    - **Answer:** `useRef` is used to access DOM elements and keep mutable references in functional components. Unlike `createRef`, it persists across renders.
    - **Follow-up 1:** Can `useRef` be used for anything other than DOM references? 1
    - **Answer:** Yes, `useRef` can also be used to hold mutable variables without triggering re-renders.
    - **Follow-up 2:** What happens if you modify the `.current` property of a `useRef` object?
    - **Answer:** Modifying `.current` will not trigger a re-render of the component.

4. **Question:** Explain the `useReducer` Hook.
    - **Answer:** `useReducer` is used for more complex state logic and takes a reducer function and initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch function.
    - **Follow-up 1:** When would you use `useReducer` over `useState`?
    - **Answer:** `useReducer` is beneficial when you have complex state transitions or when you want centralized control over state updates.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Can `useReducer` work with middleware?
    - **Answer:** By default, no. But you can wrap the dispatch function to add middleware-like behavior.

5. **Question:** How do you custom Hooks?
    - **Answer:** Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions that start with 'use' and may call other Hooks. They let you extract component logic into reusable functions.
    - **Follow-up 1:** Can custom Hooks use lifecycle events?
    - **Answer:** Custom Hooks can use `useEffect` to mimic lifecycle events but don't have lifecycle methods themselves.
    - **Follow-up 2:** What is the main advantage of using custom Hooks?
    - **Answer:** Custom Hooks improve code reusability and separation of concerns by isolating and sharing logic across components.

6. **Question:** What is `useContext` and how is it used?
    - **Answer:** `useContext` allows you to consume context values in a functional component, eliminating the need to use the `Context.Consumer` component.
    - **Follow-up 1:** How do you provide a value to `useContext`?
    - **Answer:** The context value is provided using a `Context.Provider` wrapping the component tree.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Can multiple contexts be consumed in a single component?
    - **Answer:** Yes, you can use multiple `useContext` calls to consume multiple context values in a single component.

I hope these questions help you prepare for your interviews! Feel free to ask if you need more information or clarification.
