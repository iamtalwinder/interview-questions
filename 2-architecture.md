Certainly, here are 6 intermediate to advanced questions related to React architecture, each accompanied by two follow-ups and a two-line answer for each question.

### React Architecture (6 questions)

1. **Question:** What is the concept of lifting state up in React?
    - **Answer:** Lifting state up involves moving the state to the nearest common ancestor, to facilitate data sharing among sibling components.
    - **Follow-up 1:** When should you lift the state up?
    - **Answer:** You should lift the state up when multiple components need access to the same state or when the state needs to be synchronized.
    - **Follow-up 2:** What are the drawbacks of lifting state up?
    - **Answer:** It can make the parent component bloated and harder to maintain.

2. **Question:** What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?
    - **Answer:** A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.
    - **Follow-up 1:** Can you list some use-cases for HOCs?
    - **Answer:** HOCs are commonly used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and conditional rendering.
    - **Follow-up 2:** How do HOCs differ from Render Props?
    - **Answer:** HOCs use composition, while Render Props use a function prop to share code, offering more flexibility in the component structure.

3. **Question:** How do you handle side-effects in React?
    - **Answer:** Side-effects can be managed using lifecycle methods in class components or `useEffect` in functional components.
    - **Follow-up 1:** What are some examples of side-effects?
    - **Answer:** API calls, timers, and subscriptions are examples of side-effects.
    - **Follow-up 2:** How can you isolate side-effects?
    - **Answer:** Side-effects can be isolated using `useEffect` by specifying dependencies or by using custom Hooks.

4. **Question:** What is the role of a Virtual DOM in React?
    - **Answer:** The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements, which optimizes re-rendering for better performance.
    - **Follow-up 1:** How does React update the real DOM?
    - **Answer:** React uses a "diffing" algorithm to find differences between the real DOM and Virtual DOM, updating only the changed parts.
    - **Follow-up 2:** Can you bypass the Virtual DOM?
    - **Answer:** Yes, using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or direct DOM manipulation, but it's generally discouraged due to potential issues like XSS attacks.

5. **Question:** What is JSX and how is it different from HTML?
    - **Answer:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like elements, but it gets transpiled into React.createElement() calls.
    - **Follow-up 1:** Is JSX mandatory for writing React components?
    - **Answer:** No, JSX is not mandatory; you can use `React.createElement`, but JSX makes the code more readable.
    - **Follow-up 2:** What are some key differences between JSX and HTML?
    - **Answer:** In JSX, `className` replaces `class`, and `htmlFor` replaces `for`. Also, JSX expressions are embedded in curly braces `{}`.

6. **Question:** What are Controlled and Uncontrolled Components?
    - **Answer:** Controlled components have their state managed by React, while in uncontrolled components, the DOM itself manages the state.
    - **Follow-up 1:** When would you use an uncontrolled component?
    - **Answer:** Uncontrolled components are useful for one-off inputs or when you want to integrate with non-React code.
    - **Follow-up 2:** How can you convert an uncontrolled component to a controlled one?
    - **Answer:** By setting the value of the input element based on the component's state and updating it through event handlers.

I hope these questions help deepen your understanding of React architecture. Feel free to ask for clarifications or further details!
